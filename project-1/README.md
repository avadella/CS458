# Project 1 - Classical Encryption
# Description 
Write a program that accepts the following input from the user (not necessarily in this order):
1. An input text file name
2. An output text file name
3. A key (or the name of a file containing the key)
4. An encryption algorithm (perhaps from a menu)
5. Encrypt or Decrypt

Your program should take this information and perform the desired encryption or decryption. You should support all of the following algorithms:
- Shift Cipher
- Substitution Cipher (use the keyword method described on p. 13 of The Code Book and in class)
- Affine Cipher
- Vigenere Cipher
Use the following alphabetic encoding scheme: A = 0, B = 1, ... Z = 25. Non-alphabetic characters should be ignored.
